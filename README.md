# Decibase
A music metadata database and tagging application

## Project Goal
This application will allow users to store and organize metadata for audio files. It will allow users to input information such as song title, artist, album name, genre, track and disk numbers, years, and so on. 

The application will store the information in a database with linked tables for song, artist and album information. The database table for song information will contain a link to each songs respective audio file, and as a stretch goal will also allow the application to read and write to the id3 tag embedded in the file.
